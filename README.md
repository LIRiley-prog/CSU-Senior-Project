# Project Title
Meccanoid AI Assistant 
Brief Project Description
This projet implements an intereactive AI robot, capable of understanding voice commands, real time responses, performing controlled motor movements. The system integrates speech rocognition, text to speech output, LLM decision logic. The robot is designed to operate safely, respond naturally to user input, and change its behavior through modular AI components. 

## Compile/Deploy
git clone LIRiley-prog/CSU-Senior-Project
cd project-folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py

## Usage
The robot can respond to voice commands
- Act as a personal assistant
- Display personalities or preset behaviors
- Interacts conversationally using AI
- Reacts to emotional cues or keywords
- Performs gestures or movements during interactions
## Options
--debug (Enables detailed loggiing for testing and troubleshooting)
--simulate (Runs AI logic without using the motors)
--safe (Limits motor speed and power for safe indoor testing)
--mute (disables audio output)
--log (Saves system logs to the specified file)
## Testing
-Unit Testing (AI decision logic, speech processing functions)
-Hardware Diagnostics (Proper operation of motors, sensors, power systems)
-Integration Testing (Voice recognition, movement control)
-Scenario Based Evaluation (Real user interactions, movement commands, error handling, and emeergency stop responses)
